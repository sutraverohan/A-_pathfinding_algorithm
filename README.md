# A*_pathfinding_algorithm


This A* Path Finding algorithm will show you how to implement the a* search algorithm using python.This is a path finding visualizer tool to visualize the a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs. This aster pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient that your standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search.
